2. write a func which will be able to print index of all the primitive element which you will pass

3. write a func which will take a nested dict and give me output as a list of all the values even in case of 2 
level nesting it should be work.

4. write a fun which will take another func as an input and return me an output

5. write a function which will take multiple list as a input and give me concatnation of all the element as and output

6. write a function which will be able to take a list as an input return an index of each element like a inbuilt
index function but even if we have repetative element it should return index

7.write a function which will should return list of all the file name from  a directory.

8. write a func which will be able to show your systm configuration

find wheather in current directory, we have pdf or not
if pdf = 0, do nothing
if pdf>0, merge all the pdf

by using tkinter,kivy lib
kivy is best

RESTRICTION::
Use logging
use modular coding
use exception handling


22.create a class for directory parsing

1.write a function to give all the keys
2.write a function to give all the values
3.write a function to throw an exception in case of input is not dict
4.write a func for take user input and then parse a key and value out of dict
5. write a function to insert new key value pair into directory


23. create your own package for all the list function
24. create your own package for all the tuple function
25. create your own package for all dictionary function
26. create your own package for all the set function

	restriction:
		alawys use exception handling
		never use print statement
		alawys use logging while writting a code and log every activity performed by code in respective logging file


27. create a file class for reading data from respective file with a method name read and write.
    1. try to inherit read and write method from parent class to child class to perform read and write operation.




q1 - create your own class for to achieve , multiple and multilevel inheritance
q2 - create your own class to represent polymorphism
q3 - create your own class for custome exception
q4 - create your own calss to achive encapsulation
q5 - create your own class to achive method overloading and overriding.

3. try to filter out all the data without punctuation./try to filter out all the words from dataset.
