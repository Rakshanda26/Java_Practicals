String is a set of character
List is collection of homogeneous and hetorogeneous element
tuple is like list  It is collection of data type 
Tuple is a immutable collection
Tuple object does not support item assignment
Tuple is used for data security
Set is a collection of unique element .It removes duplicate element
Set is not allows slicing operations.It is subscriptable.
Set allows you to add only primitive host
In set we cannot add list 
Set alawys hold unorder collection of unique element.It finds the uniqueness in primitive data type 
In set we can add tuples bcoz tuple is immutable.
SET removes duplicate tuples inside set.for uniqueness
In case of unorder collection we not get indices (EG. SET) ..In this case we cant do manuplation operations
Set is not mutable or immutable it is unorder.
SET is case sensitive.  eg.{"sudh" , "Sudh" }
In dict we cant able to use special character,underscore as a key
In dict we use key value pair.
Key should be alawys unique .
Key should be immutable element so we can give tuple as key
While loop is alawys work based on the conditions
Print alawys try to return none type
CTR +SHIFT +ESC gives you system configurantion
String is iterable object not iterator
Int is not iterable
iter()func is try to convert  iterable into iterator
Genarator is a kind of a object which will be able to genarate a data set for us by following certain rules that we are mention
without storing each and everything into the memory.
Yeild will help you out to convert a func as a genarator ... and it not giving you list....it throws the dataset on console one by one.
Yeild remember 3 things .. what i produce last time..what is the logic ...and where i have to stop 
yeild helps  you to internally memory management where you avoid to produce old thing to produce new one 
Exception is a super class of a exception
sub class (i/o , arithematic , out of index)
Packages are collection of modules
KIVY and TINKER KT libs are used to make GUI.
####INIT FUNCTION#########

Init is nothing but a constuctor
constuctor is nothing but something which will try to pass a data to a class.
self is a pointer
Polymorphism - one single object or entity but if its behaviour is change with diff diff situation that is called as polymorphism
multiple forms


DECORATORS are nothing but a predefined /prewritten func which is available inside the python module Its a symbolic representation , if i use staticmethod decorator in that case just use that method as static method not as a instance method


If i try to create variable whose values will be same for everything for all fun and method i create a static variable
If i would try to create static fun which is not having any dependancies with resp to object creation then i ll use static fun


Abstraction is nothing but a blueprint

Hi

while solving the below question

**3. How to remove duplicate rows from Employees table.**

WITH WORKERCTE AS
(
   SELECT  *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY WORKER_ID ORDER BY WORKER_ID) AS ROWNUMBER 
   FROM WORKER
)
DELETE FROM WORKERCTE WHERE ROWNUMBER >1;

I am getting this error > Error Code: 1288. The target table WORKERCTE of the DELETE is not updatable
